## Profiles

By default, Selfinfo provides an infromation about current CKAN APP, which might be not enough where CKAN infostructure is split between different environments (instances).

Due to this, `profiles` are added. This is an ability to get information about other Evnrionments on one Page. By default, main Selfinfo screen is marked under `default`, where all other profiles will have other labels or machine names.
